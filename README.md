Converts English input to katakana and hiragana Japanese characters. If characters were not converted, this is because the English romaji equivalent does not exist. 

The point was to write code in the style of jQuery, so that the convert character functionalilty could be applied easily to html elements. Note that this is not optimal, since this was my first javascript challange project.
